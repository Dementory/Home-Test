An error occurs from the <b>JSONPlaceholder</b> side and therefore pictures dont't download. But when downloading from other sources everything is fine. In the script Assets/Scripts/Database/Downloder.cs on line 13 I replace the image link from <b>JSONPlaceholder</b> to another one. You can remove this line if you want to check.
